# Readme

This is a loose collection of various plugins I write/wrote
for the [GNU MediaGoblin](http://mediagoblin.org) project.

A while ago I dumped flickr and deviantart and migrated to
my own [MediaGoblin instance](http://media.micha.elmueller.net). 
I have been sitting silently on the developers list since then. 
I guess it's finally time to start developing :).

**Project status:** I am just starting out writing stuff for
MediaGoblin. Some things may still be a little bit wobbly.


# Plugins

An advanced version of the 
[sampleplugin](http://mediagoblin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pluginwriter/quickstart.html)
